Welcome to Vector Elite!

This is a game developed by Josh Peters, available on Steam and Oculus stores.

As an avid VR user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

This game does not require any account registration or sign in information and does not take into account any information when playing or when starting. However, many online game stores, including 
OCULUS HOME, do require users to register in order to play the games available in the store. Vector Elite does not have access to any of this information.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
Josh Peters.
